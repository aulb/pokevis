##### What kind of data?
All the basic Pokemon data, and just Pokemon
- No need for Pokemon hold items
- Includes color (for the future)

##### What kind of visualization am I trying to do?
Competitive data, competitive data over the last 7 generation

## Data gathering, requirements
Initially PokeAPI, but this is too much to gather data from. Use their csvs instead. Build my own database and convert back into csv. Pretty much creating a flatter csv in the end. 

## Tables to do sorted by priority!

--- | --- | --- | ---
pk_pokemon_id | INT | PK

###### Step 1: Gather all the data required from PokeAPI
Simply farm their csvs from github.

###### Step 2: Setup tables with (NOT NULL) option disabled. No foreign keys, just primary keys since there are gonna be gaps.

###### Step 3: Put cvs data into the table.


###### Step 4: Design tables for competitive data


###### Step ?: Setup database -> csv since the data is pretty much static



###### Visualization
###### Step 1: Figure out what kind of visualization, how it would look etc.
- Type per generation
	Filters:
		- Primary type only
		- Secondary type only

- Stats

- Competitive, who was stronger? OP. Smogon tiers ONLY
